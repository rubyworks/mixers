= Preinitialize

Require the library.

    require 'mixers/preinitialize'

Use example module.

   module M
     def preinitialize
       @a = 23
     end
   end

Define a class to support it.

   class X
     include Preinitializable
     include M
     def a ; @a ; end
   end

The result should be:

   x = X.new
   x.a.assert == 23
