= OpenStructable

Require the library.

  require 'mixers/ostructable'

We will use the simpliest example class:

  class X
    include OpenStructable
  end

  x = X.new

So arbitrary attributes can be added to the object
just as if it were an OpenStruct.

  x.a = 1
  x.b = 2

  x.assert.a == 1
  x.assert.a == 2
